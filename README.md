# Simple_Linear_Regression
Machine Learning Model Used to predict Housing Prices based of Multiple Features. 

I have Used Simple Linear regression with only a few elements of Complex Linear Regression to make this project.

I have defined and used RMSE and R2 within the project and used multiple Python Libraries and to achieve my objective.
I have also relied on external sources during the making of this project which I have mentioned at the end of the project.

This is just a practise ML Model and my first one at that so please be open minded while analyzing it.

I hope you learn something new from this.
